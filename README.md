## Java-Spring-Hibernate-Examples-Dependency-Injection-CRUD-and-Transaction-Management

A collection of simple Java programs demonstrating core Spring and Hibernate concepts in both plain Java (for online compilers) and Spring Boot setups.
Covers:

Part A: Spring Dependency Injection using Java-based configuration (@Configuration, @Bean, @Autowired)

Part B: Hibernate ORM CRUD operations on a Student entity (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Part C: Transaction Management in a simulated banking system ensuring rollback and atomicity

Includes both conceptual (runnable without setup) and real-world ready code samples to help students and beginners understand the integration of Spring + Hibernate.
